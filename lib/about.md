# In a nutshell

I'm a computer science enthusiast from Costa Rica. In the past five years, I've gone from writing my first "Hello World" in Java to developing web, desktop, and mobile apps. I'm still a beginner, but I want to share what I've learned on this blog. Join me as I explore the fascinating world of computer science!

# (Not) In a nutshell

Growing up in Costa Rica, I was fortunate to be surrounded by friends and family who were enthusiastic about technology. It wasn't long before I became curious about programming myself. My initial motivation was to create video games, but as I delved deeper into the subject, I discovered a fascination with all that programming had to offer.

Now, as a student of Computer Science and Multimedia at the University of Costa Rica, I'm expanding my horizons even further. I recently had the opportunity to study Computer Science abroad at the University of MÃ¡laga in Spain, which opened my eyes to new perspectives and possibilities.

In addition, I'm also a member of PyLabUCR, a group where we share our knowledge and passion for Python programming.
To further share my love for programming, I created the Code Citadel. Through my blog, I hope to inspire and guide fellow enthusiasts on their own programming journeys. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, I believe that we can all benefit from sharing knowledge and experiences. So, I invite you to explore my writings and discover new insights that can help you in your own quest for programming mastery.

I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next, and I can't wait to continue exploring the limitless potential of technology.
